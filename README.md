This is an XFWM4 theme based on the Classic Mac look, but modernized
to support both dark mode and high DPI.

This theme is based directly on the Copland theme here: https://www.xfce-look.org/p/1204016/

Just use `make` and `make install` to install the theme. The theme
is named `rain-retro-modern`, with `-2x` up to `-4x` for high DPI,
and `-dark` for dark mode.
